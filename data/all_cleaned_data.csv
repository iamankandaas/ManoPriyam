"You know, I've been dealing with this whole thing as the band leader in our college music society, and today the union finally got back to us about the budget for new equipment, but they straight up denied it, saying something about funds being tight this semester. It hit me hard because we've been practicing with these old amps that buzz more than they play, and I was really counting on upgrading for the upcoming inter-college fest. Coming , this just feels like a slap, you know? I tried arguing in the meeting, but it was like talking to a wall, and now I'm left figuring out how to tell the team without killing their vibe. Maybe we'll fundraise or something, but honestly, it's exhausting juggling this POR with my engineering classes.",anger
"Waking up to prepare for the NSS blood donation camp I organized as the coordinator felt good initially, but then the turnout was way lower than expected, only about 30 people showed up when we aimed for 100. As someone who grew up in a Christian household in Goa where charity drives during Christmas are a big deal, I thought this would be fulfilling, but seeing the empty chairs made me question if I'm cut out for this role. I spent hours promoting it through posters and WhatsApp groups, even got the college doctor involved, yet people just didn't show. It leaves me with this neutral feeling, like the effort was there but the impact wasn't, and now I have to report back to the faculty advisor.",neutral
"Handling the sponsorship for our tech fest as the head has been a nightmare today, one major sponsor backed out citing budget cuts, and I'm scrambling to find replacements.

"Today in the drama club rehearsal as the director, we finally nailed the climax scene after weeks of practice, and it brought this rush of joy seeing everyone sync perfectly. Growing up in Mumbai with a love for Bollywood, directing this play on social issues feels like a dream, even though we had some hiccups with lighting. The cast's energy was infectious, and sharing laughs post-rehearsal made me forget the stress of coordinating props and scripts. Can't wait for the performance next month.",joy
"As the cultural secretary planning the Diwali event, today's meeting with the committee turned sour when they dismissed my ideas for traditional dances, opting for modern fusion instead, which left me angry. , this feels like erasing our roots, and I argued passionately but got outvoted.

"Volunteering for the environmental club's tree-planting drive today was okay, we planted about 50 saplings, but the heat was draining, and not many showed up. As a nature lover , I believe in these initiatives, but the lack of participation makes it feel neutral, like we're doing our part but the bigger change isn't happening. Ended the day with a group discussion on sustainability, which was insightful at least.",neutral
"Leading the debate team as captain, today's practice session went south when a key member forgot their arguments, and I'm scared we won't be ready for the nationals.

"Organized a poetry slam in the literary society today, and hearing everyone's pieces on personal struggles was moving, especially since I'm . As the head, seeing the turnout and applause filled me with joy, like we created a space for expression amid college chaos.",joy
"As sports secretary, the rain canceled our inter-hostel cricket match today after all the prep, and I'm furious at the weather and the committee for not having a backup plan. , this was supposed to be big, but now the team's morale is low, and I regret not pushing for an indoor option.",anger

"Inter hostel kabaddi match today, crowd was wild, made my first successful raid in weeks. Adrenaline rush was real dodging, crowd roaring, physicality of it all. For a moment, I was the hero, not the guy always struggling. Got slammed hard during a tackle, ribs still ache. Coach said I did ok, but I wish hed say more.",joy
"Fitness test day. Aced push ups, but beep test was embarrassing. Dropped out halfway, gasping, while the rest of the team just kept going. Watching the guys who barely train cruise through like its nothing stings. I know I shouldnt compare, but its hard not to. Maybe Im just not cut out.",sadness
"Gym was closed for maintenance, did a bodyweight circuit in my room. Jump squats, burpees, chair dips sweat dripping, breath ragged. For once, actually felt strong, even without weights. Maybe Ive been relying too much on machines and not enough on myself.",joy

"Basketball drills in the rain, slipped all over the court. Coach said he appreciates the effort, but I just felt stupid, soaked and cold. Shoes ruined, hands numb, ball feels like ice. Sometimes I wonder if Im pushing myself for the wrong reasons because I want to stand out, not because I love it.",sadness
"Woke up with my back locked, probably from those deadlifts with bad form. Could barely get out of bed, let alone run. Sat in class all day, stiff as a board, imagining everyone talking about how I chickened out of training. Sometimes, I wish Id never started this whole fitness thing.",sadness

"Judo intro today, got thrown in my first sparring, landed hard, wind knocked out. Sensei said good technique, but I just felt like a ragdoll. Not sure if Ill go back, kinda scared.",fear
"Football trials again, got subbed in, made a decent pass, got subbed out. Sat on the bench, sweating, watching the coach ignore me. Felt like I dont even exist.",sadness
"Ran at sunrise, mist, dew, field empty, just me and my thoughts. No goals, no timers, just running. Feels freeing, but then reality hits exams, placements, future, everything.",neutral
"Table tennis in the common room, Im terrible but friends just laugh and keep playing. For once, it wasnt about fitness or performance, just fun. Sometimes, thats all I want.",joy

Crush started dating my roommate. Now I have to watch them cuddle on the balcony every evening. College love is a cruel joke.,sadness

"Broke up with my girlfriend, mutual decision, but still sad. Guess not every love story is for the long run, sometimes its just for campus life.",sadness
"I like this girl, but shes out of my league whatever that means in a country where people still care about caste, class, and log kya kahenge. Its exhausting.",sadness
"Had a fling with a girl in my society, she ghosted me after her vacations. Feels like Im an extra in her lifes movie, not even a side character.",sadness
"Boyfriends mom sent me a friendly message, but I think shes keeping tabs. Indian love means you date the whole family, not just the guy.",fear

"Fell for my best friend of 6 years. It hit me out of nowhere now every late night call feels loaded, and Im scared to ruin things.",fear
"Casual dating is fun till your relatives start sending you rishta profiles. Just wanted a summer fling, not a lecture on settling down.",disgust
"Girlfriend and I are on a break. We both have finals, so even our breakup is Indian style postponed for academic reasons.",neutral
"Ended up confessing to my crush via voice note at 2 AM. No reply yet. Not sure if its love or just exam stress making me reckless. Either way, I regret nothing.",neutral
