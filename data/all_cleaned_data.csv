"You know, I've been dealing with this whole thing as the band leader in our college music society, and today the union finally got back to us about the budget for new equipment, but they straight up denied it, saying something about funds being tight this semester. It hit me hard because we've been practicing with these old amps that buzz more than they play, and I was really counting on upgrading for the upcoming inter-college fest. Coming , this just feels like a slap, you know? I tried arguing in the meeting, but it was like talking to a wall, and now I'm left figuring out how to tell the team without killing their vibe. Maybe we'll fundraise or something, but honestly, it's exhausting juggling this POR with my engineering classes.",anger
"Waking up to prepare for the NSS blood donation camp I organized as the coordinator felt good initially, but then the turnout was way lower than expected, only about 30 people showed up when we aimed for 100. As someone who grew up in a Christian household in Goa where charity drives during Christmas are a big deal, I thought this would be fulfilling, but seeing the empty chairs made me question if I'm cut out for this role. I spent hours promoting it through posters and WhatsApp groups, even got the college doctor involved, yet people just didn't show. It leaves me with this neutral feeling, like the effort was there but the impact wasn't, and now I have to report back to the faculty advisor.",neutral
"Handling the sponsorship for our tech fest as the head has been a nightmare today, one major sponsor backed out citing budget cuts, and I'm scrambling to find replacements.

"Today in the drama club rehearsal as the director, we finally nailed the climax scene after weeks of practice, and it brought this rush of joy seeing everyone sync perfectly. Growing up in Mumbai with a love for Bollywood, directing this play on social issues feels like a dream, even though we had some hiccups with lighting. The cast's energy was infectious, and sharing laughs post-rehearsal made me forget the stress of coordinating props and scripts. Can't wait for the performance next month.",joy
"As the cultural secretary planning the Diwali event, today's meeting with the committee turned sour when they dismissed my ideas for traditional dances, opting for modern fusion instead, which left me angry. , this feels like erasing our roots, and I argued passionately but got outvoted.

"Volunteering for the environmental club's tree-planting drive today was okay, we planted about 50 saplings, but the heat was draining, and not many showed up. As a nature lover , I believe in these initiatives, but the lack of participation makes it feel neutral, like we're doing our part but the bigger change isn't happening. Ended the day with a group discussion on sustainability, which was insightful at least.",neutral
"Leading the debate team as captain, today's practice session went south when a key member forgot their arguments, and I'm scared we won't be ready for the nationals. Coming , this POR means a lot, but the pressure is mounting with conflicting schedules. I tried motivating them, but the fear of underperforming keeps nagging at me.",fear
"Organized a poetry slam in the literary society today, and hearing everyone's pieces on personal struggles was moving, especially since I'm . As the head, seeing the turnout and applause filled me with joy, like we created a space for expression amid college chaos.",joy
"As sports secretary, the rain canceled our inter-hostel cricket match today after all the prep, and I'm furious at the weather and the committee for not having a backup plan. , this was supposed to be big, but now the team's morale is low, and I regret not pushing for an indoor option.",anger
