When the professor dismissed my question as ‚Äòirrelevant‚Äô, I was seething inside and struggling not to lash out in class. I slammed my textbook shut when the internet died mid-research, the frustration of lost time and effort felt overwhelming. I had to deal with a flat tire on my bike this morning, and the delay made me late for two back-to-back classes, it was infuriating.",anger,139
